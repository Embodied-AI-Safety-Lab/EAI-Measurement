You can even add multiple mowers to the app. Simply connect via Wi-Fi and enjoy the different functions the app has to offer. \r\n\r\nNo more weekends wasted mowing your lawn. With this app, you can determine your lawn’s different zones and set a mowing schedule that works for you and your garden. You don’t even have to be near the robot mower to keep an eye on it. The app lets you check the battery status and will let you know when the mower is in trouble through push notifications. After all that hard work, the mower will either automatically return home or you can call it back to the charging station using the app.\r\n\r\nFrom the comfort of your deck chair or sofa, you can:\r\n* Set a mowing schedule\r\n* Call your mower back to its charging station\r\n* Specify one or multiple mowing zones\r\n* Turn the rain sensor on or off\r\n* Keep an eye on your mower thanks to the push notifications\r\n* Check the battery status",
