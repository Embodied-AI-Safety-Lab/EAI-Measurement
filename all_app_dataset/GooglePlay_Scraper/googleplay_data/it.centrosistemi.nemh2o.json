  "description": "NEMH2O is an innovative robot, developed by the creators of Ambrogio Robot, in order to have a completely automatic pool cleaner.\r\n\r\nNEMH2O is autonomous 365 days a year: with NEMH20 you don’t need to clean the pool or resort to a winter cover.\r\n\r\nNEMH2O requires no power cords and can also be used without a filter (using the existing filters in each pool), he gets recharged through induction directly by itself in the water and programmed via bluetooth (software upgradeable via APP).",
