  "description": "We have released the RoboKit mobile application with which you can remotely control Kitfort robots.\r\nOn the first launch of the application, select a robot and connect it.\r\nAfter connecting, you can control the robot while away from home. For example, on leaving work, go to the application and click on the Start button. You will come home to a nice clean floor.\r\nTo avoid having to press a button every time you can set a cleaning schedule for the whole week.\r\nFrom the RoboKit application, you can not only start cleaning, but also change cleaning modes and instruct the robot to charge itself.\r\nWhile moving the robot draws a cleaning map and displays it in the mobile application.\r\nThe RoboKit mobile app team is constantly working on improving features and functionality of the product.\r\nIn the near future we will launch more robots that can be controlled from the application and provide even more opportunities for users of our smart devices.\r\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please write to us at info@kitfort.ru\r\nOfficial website: https://kirfort.ru/",
