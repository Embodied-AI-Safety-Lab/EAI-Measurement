Then now is the perfect time to let ROMY work for you. Or use the app to set fixed days, times, rooms and areas to clean. ROMY cleans autonomously and independently.

We believe in empowering pilots to feel like they have control over their pricing based on their equipment, expertise and location. An array of jobs can be offered to bid, for example but not limited to - Real Estate (Commercial / Residential), 3D Mapping, Deer Recoveries, Missing Pets, Renewable Energy (Solar / Wind), Agriculture, Thermal Inspections and so much more!  This app is for businesses and the average licensed pilot looking to create opportunities with their drone.

This app offers a variety of features that makes the process user friendly, yet detailed, connecting you with job opportunities, all at your finger tips.\r\nNote:\r\n• Both Pilot and Client have one round of negotiating. \r\n• Once bid is accepted from both parties, the client is prompted to Stripe for payment. \r\n“Skyy’s the limit - Trust us to take your vision to new heights!”",
