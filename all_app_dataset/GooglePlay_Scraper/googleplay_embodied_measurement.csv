With the Philips HomeRun Robot app you can:
● Start, pause or stop cleaning and mowing remotely
● Make a precise map of your home to clean each room in no time
● Control where your robot cleans and mows
● Choose a cleaning mode per room and mowing mode per lawn
● Set up once, enjoy spotless floors and lawns daily
● Custom clean and mow for specific situations
● Get step-by-step guidance to set up easily
● Receive progress updates on each clean and mow
● Keep your data secure
 
Start, pause or stop your robot remotely
Come home to clean floors and a perfect-looking garden every day by using your Philips HomeRun vacuum, mop, and lawn mowing robot in combination with the app. Set it up once—to clean each room and mow your lawn just the way you like it—touch ‘Start’, anytime, anywhere, and let your robot do the rest.
On its first run, your robot will map your floor plan and garden. Now you have an interactive map of your home that you can use to tell your robot how and when to clean each room or to monitor how your lawn is mowed. The robot vacuum cleaner can store up to five maps.
 
Control where your robot vacuum cleaner cleans
Only want your robot to clean the kitchen, bathroom, living room? With the app, you can tell your robot which rooms you want cleaned, and in what order. If there are areas or things you’d like it to avoid—like precious items or a rug in an area you want to mop—you can tell it where not to go, or not to mop, as well.

Choose a cleaning mode for each room and mowing mode for each lawn
Give each room unique attention with one of the cleaning modes and mowing modes for your lawn. Use Dry mode to vacuum the bedroom and Wet & Dry mode to vacuum and mop hard floors. Put your robot on Quiet mode if, say, you have a meeting, or give the kitchen an extra thorough clean by using Intensive mode. Choose a mowing mode for your lawn to get the perfect looking garden.
 
Set up once. Enjoy spotless floors and lawns every day
Once you’ve created a cleaning and mowing plan, clean floors and perfectly mowed lawns are always a tap away. Tap ‘Start’ when you want your robot to begin - every day if you like, and at a time that suits your schedule.
 
Custom clean for specific situations
Had friends over and need an extra thorough clean? Or maybe the dog left paw prints in your hallway. Again. Schedule a custom clean and mow that targets specific rooms, areas.
 
Get step-by-step guidance to setup easily
From connecting to Wi-Fi to the first clean and mow, we’ll guide you through every step of getting started. You’ll find easy-to-follow instructions and how-to-videos as well.
 
Always have support at your fingertips
Have extra questions about the HomeRun app and robot? You’ll find a user manual in the app, answers to FAQs and easy access to Customer Care if need be.
 
Receive progress updates
As your robot cleans and mows, you’ll receive in-app updates. See where your robot currently is in your home and what the robot mowing progress is in your garden. Check on its battery levels and, most importantly, get notified as soon as the cleaning run or mowing is done 
 
Maintain high performance
Get the best performance from your robot by replacing parts on time. Our app lets you know when it’s time to replace parts like filters, mops, and blades, and makes it easy to order them.
 
Keep your data secure
Philips adheres to a strict privacy policy. We recommend creating an account to ensure you can save your preferences. If you prefer, you can use the app as a guest. 
 
WiFi
Philips HomeRun robot vacuum cleaners have dual band Wi-Fi so they are easy to connect to your home Wi-Fi, whether it's to 2.4 or 5.0GHz. Robot lawn mowers only connect to your 2.4GHz home Wi-Fi.

Each flight includes tools for planning, mission-based flight, data capture and post-flight analysis.  DroneMagic is ideal for commercial implementations for roof inspections, real estate, agriculture, golf courses and more.
The software’s intuitive Android-based Google Maps interface is used to easily and quickly create single, multi-point and orthomosaic mapping mission plans. The DroneMagic App includes four (4) mission operating modes: 
1. Waypoint Missions – Designed with safe takeoff and return home features, Waypoint pilotless flights are configurable to any number of pre-selected map locations that includes named waypoints to optimize flight data for post-mission analysis. 
2. NEW Mapping Missions with post-flight orthomosaic map rendering - DroneMagic includes an innovative tool to rapidly create a mapping flight grid with pre-calculated path overlap.  Mapping missions generate high-res 2D orthomosaic maps, 3D models, thermal maps and surface elevation graphics.  Post-flight photo-based ortho processing is included.  
3. Hotpoint Missions – Hotpoint flights navigate a circumference around a pre-specified geographical target. They are automated, line of sight missions that occur within remote controller range.   
4. QuickPoint Missions – QuickPoint flights are fully autonomous for beyond visual line of sight missions that have FAA Part 107 approval.  QuickPoint allows for a single point, rapid set-up, fully autonomous Hotpoint aerial drone mission (see above) 

DroneMagic Operating Features
Google Maps interface - Visualize flight plans on Google Maps with automatic screenshot capture for each mission. A hybrid integration provides satellite view with street details to optimize waypoint placement. 
Mapping - Rapidly auto-create a mapping-mission grid overlay by touching the Google Maps interface to create a four-point boundary. DroneMagic will auto-fill the mapping route based on pre-selected flight parameters.
Safety - Drone damage and loss prevention features are standard through a safe height collision and obstacle avoidance system with an optimized safe go-home height.  DroneMagic will pre-detect a safe home location before allowing takeoff.
Battery Management - Battery sensors are auto-configured based on flight plan with ability to check drone battery lifetime left.  
Data Management - Post-mission photo data transfer includes a wireless transfer option of photos from drone to a tablet’s storage and/or a hard-wired transfer to any device with USB connectivity. Storage-ready flight logs, imagery, photos, video, and uploaded files.  Google Drive storage integration with Waypoint Missions.  
Web Integration - Auto-update a website with mission media content. System will compress photos into a web-optimized format with upload to Google Drive storage.  
Video -  A satellite-detected home waypoint is automatically set.  Stream live via YouTube (applies to LOS flights)
Ortho Processing - Export and integrate with DroneMagic mapping software to generate orthomosaics, digital surface models, NDVI maps, plant health graphics and contour maps.

Tracking

To perform a tracking flight, first ensure the drone is powered on and connected to the RC. Also ensure the RC is powered on and the device is connected to the RC via the USB cable. You can check if the drone connection is successful by previewing the camera video by pressing the camera button in the app.

When the camera video preview panel is visible, tap anywhere inside the camera panel to select the object to track. The app will show a white rectangle overlay over the camera preview panel. Confirm you wish to start tracking in the popup dialog and the drone will start the tracking operation.

While the drone is in tracking mode, the button in the top left corner shows Tracking On. Pressing that button allows you to stop tracking.

Tapping anywhere inside the camera preview panel again allows you to select a different object to track. You can do this even while tracking is in progress.

While tracking is on, the video preview panel shows the live drone camera video with an overlay showing the location of the tracked objects in the frame.

When the drone is tracking, after takeoff, you can enable autonomous flight by pressing the Fly button in the bottom center panel. The drone will autonomously yaw to follow the tracked object and fly towards it if the object moves further away. Stopping autonomous flight will make the drone hover in place.

Simulator Mode

Drone Tracker app allows you to test your drone flight in simulator mode. Simply start the app, turn on your drone, make sure the RC is connected to the drone, and connect the device to the RC. Pressing the Sim On/Off button switches between simulator and normal mode. When the simulator is turned on, the button will show the Sim On status.

In simulator mode, the drone will perform takeoff, landing, and return to home functions, as if it was truly flying. You can use the control sticks on the RC to fly the drone manually in simulator mode. The map will display the drone’s simulated location. All other functions of the app are enabled including video preview and tracking. Note that the video preview shows the actual live feed from the drone’s primary camera and is not simulated.
