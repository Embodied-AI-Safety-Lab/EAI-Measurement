Each flight includes tools for planning, mission-based flight, data capture and post-flight analysis.  DroneMagic is ideal for commercial implementations for roof inspections, real estate, agriculture, golf courses and more.\r\nThe software’s intuitive Android-based Google Maps interface is used to easily and quickly create single, multi-point and orthomosaic mapping mission plans. The DroneMagic App includes four (4) mission operating modes: \r\n1. Waypoint Missions – Designed with safe takeoff and return home features, Waypoint pilotless flights are configurable to any number of pre-selected map locations that includes named waypoints to optimize flight data for post-mission analysis. \r\n2. NEW Mapping Missions with post-flight orthomosaic map rendering - DroneMagic includes an innovative tool to rapidly create a mapping flight grid with pre-calculated path overlap.  Mapping missions generate high-res 2D orthomosaic maps, 3D models, thermal maps and surface elevation graphics.  Post-flight photo-based ortho processing is included.  \r\n3. Hotpoint Missions – Hotpoint flights navigate a circumference around a pre-specified geographical target. They are automated, line of sight missions that occur within remote controller range.   \r\n4.

QuickPoint allows for a single point, rapid set-up, fully autonomous Hotpoint aerial drone mission (see above) \r\n\r\nDroneMagic Operating Features\r\nGoogle Maps interface - Visualize flight plans on Google Maps with automatic screenshot capture for each mission. A hybrid integration provides satellite view with street details to optimize waypoint placement. \r\nMapping - Rapidly auto-create a mapping-mission grid overlay by touching the Google Maps interface to create a four-point boundary. DroneMagic will auto-fill the mapping route based on pre-selected flight parameters.\r\nSafety - Drone damage and loss prevention features are standard through a safe height collision and obstacle avoidance system with an optimized safe go-home height.  DroneMagic will pre-detect a safe home location before allowing takeoff.\r\nBattery Management - Battery sensors are auto-configured based on flight plan with ability to check drone battery lifetime left.  \r\nData Management - Post-mission photo data transfer includes a wireless transfer option of photos from drone to a tablet’s storage and/or a hard-wired transfer to any device with USB connectivity. Storage-ready flight logs, imagery, photos, video, and uploaded files.  Google Drive storage integration with Waypoint Missions.  \r\nWeb Integration - Auto-update a website with mission media content. System will compress photos into a web-optimized format with upload to Google Drive storage.  \r\nVideo -  A satellite-detected home waypoint is automatically set.

The app allows you to perform visual tracking in real time using drone’s primary camera as the drone autonomously flies following the tracked object. The app allows you to view the video stream from the drone’s primary camera during the flight operation with an overlay showing the tracked object.\r\n\r\nDrone Tracker app is used with DJI drones and requires a DJ RC controller to be connected to the device. Following DJI drones are supported:\r\n\r\n1.\tMatrice 350 RTK\r\n2.\tMatrice 300 RTK\r\n3.\tDJI Mini 3\r\n4.\tDJI Mini 3 Pro\r\n5.\tDJI Mavic 3M\r\n6.\tDJI Mavic 3 Enterprise Series\r\n7.\tMatrice 30 Series\r\n\r\nThe app was developed by DeepMAV.ai.\r\n\r\nThe app allows you to safely take off, land and return to takeoff location by using the flight control panel on the bottom.\r\n\r\nTracking\r\n\r\nTo perform a tracking flight, first ensure the drone is powered on and connected to the RC. Also ensure the RC is powered on and the device is connected to the RC via the USB cable. You can check if the drone connection is successful by previewing the camera video by pressing the camera button in the app.\r\n\r\nWhen the camera video preview panel is visible, tap anywhere inside the camera panel to select the object to track. The app will show a white rectangle overlay over the camera preview panel. Confirm you wish to start tracking in the popup dialog and the drone will start the tracking operation.\r\n\r\nWhile the drone is in tracking mode, the button in the top left corner shows Tracking On. Pressing that button allows you to stop tracking.\r\n\r\nTapping anywhere inside the camera preview panel again allows you to select a different object to track. You can do this even while tracking is in progress.\r\n\r\nWhile tracking is on, the video preview panel shows the live drone camera video with an overlay showing the location of the tracked objects in the frame.\r\n\r\nWhen the drone is tracking, after takeoff, you can enable autonomous flight by pressing the Fly button in the bottom center panel. The drone will autonomously yaw to follow the tracked object and fly towards it if the object moves further away. Stopping autonomous flight will make the drone hover in place.\r\n\r\nSimulator Mode\r\n\r\nDrone Tracker app allows you to test your drone flight in simulator mode. Simply start the app, turn on your drone, make sure the RC is connected to the drone, and connect the device to the RC. Pressing the Sim On/Off button switches between simulator and normal mode. When the simulator is turned on, the button will show the Sim On status.\r\n\r\nIn simulator mode, the drone will perform takeoff, landing, and return to home functions, as if it was truly flying. You can use the control sticks on the RC to fly the drone manually in simulator mode. The map will display the drone’s simulated location. All other functions of the app are enabled including video preview and tracking. Note that the video preview shows the actual live feed from the drone’s primary camera and is not simulated.\r\n\r\nNo account creation or login required. Simply start the app and start flying.\r\n\r\nMake sure to fly responsibly and obey your local drone regulations.",

        "description": "Drone Autonomy is an app used for autonomous drone flights with DJI drones. The app supports two modes of flight autonomy. In Position mode, you can control where the drone navigates by selecting locations on the map. In Area flight mode, you can define an area on the map and the drone navigates autonomously within the defined flight boundary. Drone Autonomy allows you to live stream the video feed from the drone’s primary camera to a streaming service such as YouTube over the internet.\r\n\r\nDrone Autonomy app is used with DJI drones and requires a DJ RC controller to be connected to the device. Following DJI drones are supported:\r\n1.\tMatrice 350 RTK\r\n2.\tMatrice 300 RTK\r\n3.\tDJI Mini 3\r\n4.\tDJI Mini 3 Pro\r\n5.\tDJI Mavic 3M\r\n6.\tDJI Mavic 3 Enterprise Series\r\n7.\tMatrice 30 Series\r\n\r\nThe app was developed by DeepMAV.ai.\r\n\r\nPerform automatic takeoff by pressing the Take Off button in the app. Upon takeoff, you can switch on autonomous flight by pressing the Fly button in the flight control panel.\r\n\r\nPosition Autonomy Mode\r\n\r\nWhen in autonomous flight in Position mode, the drone will navigate to the defined target location while maintaining the chosen altitude above takeoff. Upon reaching the target location, the drone will hover in place. Simply tap on the map to define the target location for the drone. Pressing the Clear Target button removes the defined target and makes the drone hover in place.\r\n\r\nArea Autonomy Mode\r\n\r\nWhen in Area mode, tapping on the map allows you to define the vertices of the flight area within which the drone will fly. Pressing the Save Area button saves the defined flight area and displays it on the map. Pressing the Clear Area button removes the defined flight area. You may define a flight area of any polygonal shape.\r\n\r\nWhen you activate the autonomous flight in Area mode by pressing the Fly button, the drone will start flying autonomously within the defined flight area, while maintaining the chosen altitude above takeoff. The drone will never leave the bounds of the defined flight area during the flight.\r\n\r\nDeactivating the autonomous flight by pressing the Stop button will hold the drone in place. Autonomous flight may be resumed by pressing on the Fly button once again.\r\n\r\nAutomatic landing and return to home functions may be engaged by pressing the Land and Home buttons on the flight control panel.\r\n\r\nLive Streaming\r\n\r\nDrone Autonomy app allows you to live stream the video feed from the drone’s primary camera to a streaming service such as YouTube. The live streaming requires that the device is connected to the internet or a network where the streaming service can be reached.\r\n\r\nIn order to live stream the drone video, first enable the camera view by pressing the Camera button. Once the camera view is visible, pressing the Live Stream button allows you to select the URL of the streaming service you wish to stream to and start the stream.\r\n\r\nWhile live streaming is active, the Live Stream button will flash red. Turning off live streaming can be done by pressing the flashing Live Stream button.\r\n\r\nSimulator Mode\r\n\r\nDrone Autonomy app allows you to test your drone flight in simulator mode. Simply start the app, turn on your drone, make sure the RC is connected to the drone, and connect the device to the RC. Pressing the Sim On/Off button switches between simulator and normal mode. When the simulator is turned on, the button will show the Sim On status.\r\n\r\nIn simulator mode, the drone will perform takeoff, autonomous flight, landing, or return to home functions, as if it was truly flying. The map will display the drone’s simulated location. All other functions of the app are enabled including Position and Area mode and live streaming.\r\n\r\nNo account creation or login required. Simply start the app and start flying.\r\n\r\nMake sure to fly responsibly and obey your local drone regulations.",
