Give each room unique attention with one of the cleaning modes and mowing modes for your lawn. Use Dry mode to vacuum the bedroom and Wet & Dry mode to vacuum and mop hard floors.

Choose a mowing mode for your lawn to get the perfect looking garden.

 

Set up once. Enjoy spotless floors and lawns every day

Once you’ve created a cleaning and mowing plan, clean floors and perfectly mowed lawns are always a tap away. Tap ‘Start’ when you want your robot to begin - every day if you like, and at a time that suits your schedule.

 

Custom clean for specific situations

Had friends over and need an extra thorough clean? Or maybe the dog left paw prints in your hallway. Again. Schedule a custom clean and mow that targets specific rooms, areas.

From connecting to Wi-Fi to the first clean and mow, we’ll guide you through every step of getting started. You’ll find easy-to-follow instructions and how-to-videos as well.

 

Always have support at your fingertips

MassageRobot,2,"Life hurts, so the founders designed a life-sized autonomous massage robot with collaborative robotic arms and cloud artificial intelligence. Users can control robot motion and force with their normal voice in more than 100 languages or dialects. With Machine Learning, the robot can create and recommend massage routines. In addition, users can build their own personalized routines and then share them using this intuitive mobile app.\n\nKey Features–\n\n-Choose routines from the following massage routine categories: For you, Activities, Ailments, Lifestyle, Sports, Target Areas, Wellness, and Workout.\n\n-Get a recommendation from the robot’s recommendation engine.\n\n-See routine details including tool, location, force, speed and paths.\n\n-Create your own routine.\n\n-Let the robot create a routine for you.\n\n-Run a routine when you visit us for a demonstration.\n\nEngineering --\nThe robot is connected to Google Cloud Platform and utilizes AI, ML, and Natural Language Processing services. Algorithms and AI enable the robot to recognize patterns of what humans prefer. It is learning what humans like. It’s already evolving. Using a Deep Learning Recommendation Engine, the robot will eventually learn to diagnose with increasing accuracy and prescribe massage routines with precision. The robot touches humans in a way that is so unique that it has to be felt to comprehend fully.\n\n“We believe this will disrupt the global health and wellness industry for good, “stated Christian Mackin.\n\nCollaborative Robotics -- The robot has two 6-axis collaborative robotic arms that are intrinsically safe due to mass, speed, gearing, and software limits. The robot is programmed with sophisticated algorithms and equations that process parameters from a database. Parameters such as tool-ID, location, duration, path, speed, and force describe a given routine segment. Segments can be strung together into an unlimited number of different full routines.\n\nSharing Massages --The robot is integrated with this mobile App. Users can intuitively create personalized massage routines and then share them publicly or privately. The robot uses a proprietary calibration process to measure each user’s body coordinates while setting up a profile. These coordinates are then used in an algorithm that enables users to share routines, so even the largest NFL football player can share with the tiniest ballerina. \n\nDesign --\n“People generally believe massage therapy relieves pain and stress and that it’s a far better alternative to prescription drugs or surgery, but it still doesn’t appeal to everyone.” Stated Christian Mackin \n\nWHY IS THAT? We think it’s because, among other things like economics and convenience, massage has a reputation for sexual misconduct that people don’t want to associate with. Nobody wants the jokes to be about them or worse; nobody wants to be assaulted. For people with body image issues, the last thing that will relieve their stress is a stranger rubbing the imperfections they have the most insecurities about. In everything we do, Design Thinking guides how we empathize with humans. We believe good design is both beautiful and intelligent. With deliberate and distinctive use of contemporary modern style, innovative materials such as bio-resistant coverings, and Artificial Intelligence, we aim to create forms, surfaces, and technologies that excite the senses and inspire the mind. We believe our robot can transform how people find relief from the stress and pain of life. \n\nRobot-as-a-Service-\nAfter every massage it completes, the robot knows more than the last. This futuristic product is designed to be accessible by consumers today. At health and wellness centers, with a low Robot-as-a-Service (RAAS) price point, we want to enable businesses to make robotic massage accessible and affordable so it can become an integral part of everyone's wellness program."",",,,,,2022-09-14T07:00:00Z,2022-09-14T07:07:28Z,6,2022-09

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc0jPPUJCDjViXmzQxK54uA/



DroneMagic is an innovative and comprehensive autonomous drone operating application to support unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) drone missions using DJI commercial drones including the Mavic, Phantom, Inspire and Matrice series. Each flight includes tools for planning, mission-based flight, data capture and post-flight analysis.  DroneMagic is ideal for commercial implementations for roof inspections, real estate, agriculture, golf courses and more.

The software’s intuitive Android-based Google Maps interface is used to easily and quickly create single, multi-point and orthomosaic mapping mission plans. The DroneMagic App includes four (4) mission operating modes: 

1. Waypoint Missions – Designed with safe takeoff and return home features, Waypoint pilotless flights are configurable to any number of pre-selected map locations that includes named waypoints to optimize flight data for post-mission analysis. 

2. NEW Mapping Missions with post-flight orthomosaic map rendering - DroneMagic includes an innovative tool to rapidly create a mapping flight grid with pre-calculated path overlap.  Mapping missions generate high-res 2D orthomosaic maps, 3D models, thermal maps and surface elevation graphics.  Post-flight photo-based ortho processing is included.  

3. Hotpoint Missions – Hotpoint flights navigate a circumference around a pre-specified geographical target. They are automated, line of sight missions that occur within remote controller range.   

4. QuickPoint Missions – QuickPoint flights are fully autonomous for beyond visual line of sight missions that have FAA Part 107 approval.  QuickPoint allows for a single point, rapid set-up, fully autonomous Hotpoint aerial drone mission (see above) 



DroneMagic Operating Features

Google Maps interface - Visualize flight plans on Google Maps with automatic screenshot capture for each mission. A hybrid integration provides satellite view with street details to optimize waypoint placement. 

Mapping - Rapidly auto-create a mapping-mission grid overlay by touching the Google Maps interface to create a four-point boundary. DroneMagic will auto-fill the mapping route based on pre-selected flight parameters.

Safety - Drone damage and loss prevention features are standard through a safe height collision and obstacle avoidance system with an optimized safe go-home height.  DroneMagic will pre-detect a safe home location before allowing takeoff.

Battery Management - Battery sensors are auto-configured based on flight plan with ability to check drone battery lifetime left.  

Data Management - Post-mission photo data transfer includes a wireless transfer option of photos from drone to a tablet’s storage and/or a hard-wired transfer to any device with USB connectivity. Storage-ready flight logs, imagery, photos, video, and uploaded files.  Google Drive storage integration with Waypoint Missions.  

Web Integration - Auto-update a website with mission media content. System will compress photos into a web-optimized format with upload to Google Drive storage.  

Video -  A satellite-detected home waypoint is automatically set.  Stream live via YouTube (applies to LOS flights)

Ortho Processing - Export and integrate with DroneMagic mapping software to generate orthomosaics, digital surface models, NDVI maps, plant health graphics and contour maps.

Drone Tracker,4,"Drone Tracker is an app used for vision-based object tracking for DJI drones. The app allows you to perform visual tracking in real time using drone’s primary camera as the drone autonomously flies following the tracked object. The app allows you to view the video stream from the drone’s primary camera during the flight operation with an overlay showing the tracked object.



Drone Tracker app is used with DJI drones and requires a DJ RC controller to be connected to the device. Following DJI drones are supported:



1.	Matrice 350 RTK

2.	Matrice 300 RTK

3.	DJI Mini 3

4.	DJI Mini 3 Pro

5.	DJI Mavic 3M

6.	DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise Series

7.	Matrice 30 Series



The app was developed by DeepMAV.ai.



The app allows you to safely take off, land and return to takeoff location by using the flight control panel on the bottom.



Tracking



To perform a tracking flight, first ensure the drone is powered on and connected to the RC. Also ensure the RC is powered on and the device is connected to the RC via the USB cable. You can check if the drone connection is successful by previewing the camera video by pressing the camera button in the app.



When the camera video preview panel is visible, tap anywhere inside the camera panel to select the object to track. The app will show a white rectangle overlay over the camera preview panel. Confirm you wish to start tracking in the popup dialog and the drone will start the tracking operation.



While the drone is in tracking mode, the button in the top left corner shows Tracking On. Pressing that button allows you to stop tracking.



Tapping anywhere inside the camera preview panel again allows you to select a different object to track. You can do this even while tracking is in progress.



While tracking is on, the video preview panel shows the live drone camera video with an overlay showing the location of the tracked objects in the frame.



When the drone is tracking, after takeoff, you can enable autonomous flight by pressing the Fly button in the bottom center panel. The drone will autonomously yaw to follow the tracked object and fly towards it if the object moves further away. Stopping autonomous flight will make the drone hover in place.



Simulator Mode



Drone Tracker app allows you to test your drone flight in simulator mode. Simply start the app, turn on your drone, make sure the RC is connected to the drone, and connect the device to the RC. Pressing the Sim On/Off button switches between simulator and normal mode. When the simulator is turned on, the button will show the Sim On status.



In simulator mode, the drone will perform takeoff, landing, and return to home functions, as if it was truly flying. You can use the control sticks on the RC to fly the drone manually in simulator mode. The map will display the drone’s simulated location. All other functions of the app are enabled including video preview and tracking. Note that the video preview shows the actual live feed from the drone’s primary camera and is not simulated.



No account creation or login required. Simply start the app and start flying.
